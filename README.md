# Text Analysis Tools

Demonstration of text analysis using Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy and more to build machine learning models to be deployed in applications. There are also demonstrations of training, deploying and using these models in a production environment on AWS.

The focus on the stack will be a standard Python/Keras workflow for creating, training, saving, loading and running machine learning models and Python/Flask for building an accessible API for using the models. The applications will be deployed to AWS and managed there.
