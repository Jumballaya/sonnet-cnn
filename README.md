# Text Analysis Tools

Demonstration of text analysis using Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy and more to build machine learning models to be deployed in applications. There are also demonstrations of training, deploying and using these models in a production environment on AWS.

The focus on the stack will be a standard Python/Keras workflow for creating, training, saving, loading and running machine learning models and Python/Flask for building an accessible API for using the models. The applications will be deployed to AWS and managed there.

## Setup

Run the setup script in the `etc` folder. This script sets up the `venv` folder, install the requirements and dependencies and sets up any project aliases and git hooks.

Clone this repository, enter the folder and run `etc/setup.sh` in the root folder.

Everytime you use this repository you must run `source venv/bin/activate` to interact with the application.


## CLI

Use the CLI to develop, deploy and anything else needed for the repository. You can acces it by running the `project` file in the root of the project
